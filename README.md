# braincryption

Visual encryption experiment utilizing neural adaptation to visually encode information.  
By progressivly disfiguring a font while a user reads it, 
braincryption aims to subconsciously teach a user to recognize a new subset of characters. 
By doing this braincryption attempts to link new characters to existing pattern recognizers, 
rather than teach a new language or subset.
With succesful braincryption, a user could theoretically read these characters as if 
they were standard english characters while the actual characters are unrecognizable.
